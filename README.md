# README Generator 

## Description

- I was motivated to create this project to help create an easy way to create a README.md file from the command line. 

- This solves the problem of having to manually type out an entire README file and instead creates a template to create a clean, readable, & informative README file. 

- I learned how to used inquirer npm, node js, and how to create different js files to keep my code clean and organized.
